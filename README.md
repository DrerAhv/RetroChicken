## Game Description
### Synopsis
You are a disgraced biologist who’s lost their funding - and maybe their career! - due to the dearth of ethics and excess of lies displayed in your recent academic paper. In order to redeem yourself, you need to provide evidence that you’ve successfully backbred chickens into microraptors - nay, call them RetroChickens™. 

You have your humble studio tiny home, an ever-growing backyard chicken pen, and as much chicken feed as you can buy on your remaining budget. As so many famously ethical scientists say, you’ve got to crack a few hundred eggs to make a… microraptor? (Excuse me, RetroChicken™). 

Anyway, get cracking!

### Main game mechanic
- The core mechanic involves breeding chickens together to select for offspring that grow evermore raptor-like. Click on two chickens for them to produce an egg, and then hatch out their offspring using incubators. Certain traits will bring you closer to that vaunted microraptor - so get cracking!
- Chicken Hunger: Chickens need to eat to live! If a chicken grows too hungry, it will die - so be sure to feed them. But rumor has it a hungry chicken produces a more ravenous chick... maybe this would be useful for your purposes...
- Incubators: Over the course of your previous experiments, your chickens have lost their instinct to brood eggs. To fix this, you have incubators. Click on an egg to pick it up, and then click on an incubator to put it in the incubator. After five seconds, the egg will hatch, giving you a brand new chicken. As incubators can be bought
- Shop/Economy: You're living off the meager remains of your last funding disbursement, after most of academia has turned its back on you. Nevertheless, the sun turns, chickens need to be fed, and incubators need to be bought. You can sell off some of your freak eggs to your neighbors by clicking on the mailbox - surely, they'll scramble up just the same.


### Media Inspiration
The game is a 2D top-down simulation with a visual style inspired by Stardew Valley. Similar games include:
- **Stardew Valley** *(visuals)*
Stardew Valley is intended as our ‘visual DNA’ that will inform the art style and ‘feel’ of our game. Stardew Valley is a farm simulation game that includes (among other elements) cultivating agriculture and tending to animals.
- **Wobbledogs** *(genetics and pet care)*
Wobbledogs is a 3D pet simulation and breeding game that involves raising, caring for, and breeding wobbledogs in a ‘wobbledog hive’. Wobbledogs have multiple needs, such as Hunger, Play, and Sleep; Wobbledogs can die of Hunger, and can satiate their hunger by eating food that will change their ‘Gut Flora’ to reflect their diet. The Wobbledog has a chance of gaining new mutations throughout their life based on the species of bacteria in their Gut Flora. When Wobbledogs are adults they can breed with each other, with new pups inheriting a mixture of features from either parent. 
- **Slime Rancher** *('merge'-based genetics, pet care, farm 'feel')*
In Slime Rancher, you're a slime... rancher. You take care of pens full of cute slimes that you can merge together to create 'offspring' that share traits with their 'parents'. You have to feed and care for the slimes, as well.
- **Clusterduck** *(mutation-based progression)*
Produced by PikPok, Clusterduck centers around breeding ducks that, over generations, acquire more and more genetic mutations.

### Controls

This is a 'clicker game'. You're going to be using that left mouse button.

**To breed:** Click on the arrow at the bottom of the screen to open the menu, and then click on chickens to create an Egg. Click on the button with the Egg in it and bring it over to the Incubator and click on the Incubator to drop it in. A new chicken will pop out in five seconds, having inherited a mix of traits from both parents (and maybe even mutated a few new ones!)

**To sell eggs**: When you've bred two chickens, click on the Egg button and bring the egg over to the Mailbox in the lower right corner, then click on the mailbox to sell the egg. 

**To buy items:** Open the menu, then click on the item you'd like to buy and click anywhere on the map to place it. Notice your remaining money in the upper left corner - if this drops too low, you won't be able to buy anything! If you'd like to cancel your purchase, hit the Escape or Delete button before you click to place the item.
